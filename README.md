# Project Objective

Our goal is to provide a project workflow that will easily couple tasks to the assignee and allow for those tasks to be placed into categories.  

# Schemas Used

All data is stored using Mongo in the Backend of our Project

-Category: The different naming conventions used for each container, whether it be
 for different project names, or to assign urgency ratings for unassigned tasks.

-Document: googleId, name, array of tasks.

-Tag: Tags will identify properties on the comment object so that we can create custom filters.

-Task: All tasks to be completed.

-User: All users that have created accounts.
